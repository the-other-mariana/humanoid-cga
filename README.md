The development of this proyect was done using `CluViz 7.0.26.0`. You need to have a CLU Language IDE such as the mentioned in order to interpret the code. CluViz is a lightweight portable software that you can find in [resources](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/humanoid-cga/tree/master/resources). Download the complete folder and click on the exe file.<br />

Open the IDE and open the [HumanoidWalk.clu](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/humanoid-cga/blob/master/HumanoidWalk.clu) file and run the code. It will require the [Functions.clu](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/humanoid-cga/blob/master/Functions.clu) file to be in the same folder, as well as the input file. <br />
